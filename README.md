# Developing an NFT Smart Contract (ERC721)

We will develop and deploy an ERC721 (NFT) smart contract using 
1. Alchemy - Node providers manage and maintain the infrastructure required to run blockchain nodes
2. OpenZeppelin - open-source framework and library for building secure and audited smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, primarily Ethereum.
3. Remix IDE
4. Ethereum goerli opensea does not support Sepolia - Testnet

## Target

1. Write and modify the smart contract using OpenZeppelin
2. Deploy it on the Ethereum sepolia testnet blockchain to save on gas fees
3. Host the NFT tokens metadata on IPFS using Filebase
4. Mint an NFT and visualize it on OpenSea.
